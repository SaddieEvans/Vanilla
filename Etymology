<title>Angels - etymology</title>
<body>
<p><strong>Etymology</strong></p>
<p>The word angel arrives in modern English from Old English <i lang="ang">engel</i> (with a hard g) and the Old French <i lang="fro">angele</i>. Both of these derive from Late Latin 
  <i lang="lat">angelus</i> - literally <i>messenger</i>, which in turn was borrowed from Late Greek <i lang="grc">angelos</i>. The word's earliest form is Mycenaean <i>a-ke-ro</i>, 
  attested in Linear B syllabic script. Additionally, per Dutch linguist <b class="person">R. S. P. Beekes</b>, <i>angelos</i> itself may be <i>an Oriental loan</i>, like <i>angaros</i>, 
  <i>Persian mounted courier.</i></p>
<p>The rendering of <i>angelos</i> is the Septuagint's default translation of the Biblical Hebrew term <i lang="heb">mal&#39;akh</i>, denoting simply <i>messenger</i> without connoting its nature. 
In the Latin Vulgate, this meaning becomes bifurcated: when <i>mal&#39;kh</i> or <i>angelos</i> is supposed to denote a human messenger, words like nuntius or legatus are applied. 
If the word refers to some supernatural being, the word <i>angelus</i> appears. Such differentiation has been taken over by later vernacular translations of the Bible, early Christian and Jewish 
exegetes and eventually modern scholars.</p>
