  <p><h1>Angels in art</h1></p>
<p class="info">According to mainstream Christian theology, angels are wholly spiritual beings and therefore do not eat, excrete or have sex, and have no gender. Although their different roles, such as warriors for 
some archangels, may suggest a human gender, Christian artists were careful not to given them specific gender attributes, at least until the 19th century, when some acquire breasts for example.
<p class="info">In an address during a General Audience of <time>6 August 1986</time>, entitled <b class="titles">Angels participate in the history of salvation</b>, Pope John Paul II explained that <cite>The angels 
have no <i>body</i> (even if, in particular circumstances, they reveal themselves under visible forms because of their mission for the good of people).</cite> Christian art perhaps reflects the descriptions in 
Revelation 4:6–8 of the Four Living Creatures - <i lang"gre">τὰ τέσσαρα ζῷα</i> and the descriptions in the Hebrew Bible of cherubim and seraphim (the chayot in Ezekiel's Merkabah vision and the Seraphim 
of Isaiah). However, while cherubim and seraphim have wings in the Bible, no angel is mentioned as having wings. The earliest known Christian image of an angel—in the <i>Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione</i>
in the <em>Catacomb of Priscilla</em> (mid-3rd century)—is without wings. In that same period, representations of angels on sarcophagi, lamps and reliquaries also show them without wings,
as for example the angel in the Sacrifice of Isaac scene in the <em>Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</em> (although the side view of the Sarcophagus shows winged angelic figures).</p>
<p class="info">The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on the <em>Prince's Sarcophagus</em>, attributed to the time of <b class="person">Theodosius I</b> (379–395), discovered at Sarigüzel, 
near Istanbul, in the 1930s.From that period on, Christian art has represented angels mostly with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the Basilica of Saint Mary Major (432–440).Four- and six-winged 
angels, drawn from the higher grades of angels (especially cherubim and seraphim) and often showing only their faces and wings, are derived from Persian art and are usually shown only in heavenly 
contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth. They often appear in the pendentives of church domes or semi-domes. Prior to the Judeo-Christian tradition, in the Greek world the goddess Nike and 
the gods Eros and Thanatos were also depicted in human-like form with wings.</p>

<p class="quote"><b class="person">Saint John Chrysostom</b> explained the significance of angels' wings:
<cite>They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to 
approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature.</cite></p>
<hr>
<p class="info">Angels are typically depicted in Mormon art as having no wings based on a quote from <b class="person">Joseph Smith</b> - <i>An angel of God never has wings</i>. </p>

<p class="info">In terms of their clothing, angels, especially the Archangel Michael, were depicted as military-style agents of God and came to be shown wearing Late Antique military uniform. This uniform could be the 
normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, an armour breastplate and pteruges, but was often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the Byzantine Emperor, with a long tunic and the loros, 
the long gold and jewelled pallium restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards. The basic military dress was shown in Western art into the Baroque period and beyond, and up to the present 
day in Eastern Orthodox icons. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes, and in the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a deacon, a cope over a dalmatic. This costume 
was used especially for Gabriel in Annunciation scenes—for example the Annunciation in Washington by Jan van Eyck.</p>
