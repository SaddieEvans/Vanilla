<p><h1>Zoroastrianism</h1></p>
In Zoroastrianism there are different angel-like figures. For example, each person has one guardian angel, called <strong>Fravashi</strong>. They patronize human beings and other creatures, and also 
manifest God's energy. The Amesha Spentas have often been regarded as angels, although there is no direct reference to them conveying messages, but are rather emanations of <em>Ahura Mazda</em> - 
<i>Wise Lord</i>, God; they initially appeared in an abstract fashion and then later became personalized, associated with diverse aspects of the divine creation.</p>
<p><strong>Esotericism - Hermetic Qabalah</strong></p>
According to the Kabbalah as described by the Golden Dawn there are <em>ten archangels</em>, each commanding one of the choir of angels and corresponding to one of the <i>Sephirot</i>. It is similar to 
the Jewish angelic hierarchy.

<p><h1>Theosophy</h1></p>
In the teachings of the Theosophical Society, Devas are regarded as living either in the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system (Planetary Angels) or inside the Sun (Solar Angels) and they help 
to guide the operation of the processes of nature such as the process of evolution and the growth of plants; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human. It is believed 
by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the third eye is activated. Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as human beings.
It is believed by Theosophists that nature spirits, <em>elementals</em> - <b class="elementals">gnomes, undines, sylphs, and salamanders</b>, and fairies also can be observed when the third eye is 
activated. It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as humans; they are regarded as being on a separate line of spiritual 
evolution called the <i>deva evolution</i>; eventually, as their souls advance as they reincarnate, it is believed they will incarnate as devas. It is asserted by Theosophists that all of the 
above-mentioned beings possess etheric bodies that are composed of etheric matter, a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than ordinary physical plane matter.</p>
