  <h1>What are angels?</h1>
<p>An <b>angel</b> is a supernatural being in various Circum-Mediterranean religions. Abrahamic religions often depict them as benevolent celestial intermediaries between God (or Heaven) and humanity. Other roles include protectors and guides for humans, and servants of God. Abrahamic religions describe angelic hierarchies, which vary by sect and religion. Some angels have specific names (such as Gabriel or Michael) or titles (such as seraph or archangel). Humans have also used <i>angel</i> to describe various spirits and figures in other religious traditions. The theological study of angels is known as <em>angelology</em>. Those expelled from Heaven are called <strong>fallen angels</strong>, distinct from the heavenly host.
Angels in art are usually shaped like humans of extraordinary beauty. They are often identified In Christian artwork with bird wings, halos, and divine light.</p>
<p><strong>Etymology</strong></p>
<p>The word angel arrives in modern English from Old English <i lang="ang">engel</i> (with a hard g) and the Old French <i lang="fro">angele</i>. Both of these derive from Late Latin <i lang="lat">angelus</i> (literally "messenger"), which in turn was borrowed from Late Greek <i lang="grc">angelos</i>. The word's earliest form is Mycenaean <i>a-ke-ro</i>, attested in Linear B syllabic script. Additionally, per Dutch linguist <b class="person">R. S. P. Beekes</b>, <i>치ngelos</i> itself may be "an Oriental loan, like <i>치ngaros</i>, 'Persian mounted courier."
The rendering of <i>치ngelos</i> is the Septuagint's default translation of the Biblical Hebrew term <i lang="heb">mal&#39;akh</i>, denoting simply "messenger" without connoting its nature. In the Latin Vulgate, this meaning becomes bifurcated: when <i>mal&#39;kh</i> or <i>치ngelos</i> is supposed to denote a human messenger, words like nuntius or legatus are applied. If the word refers to some supernatural being, the word <i>angelus</i> appears. Such differentiation has been taken over by later vernacular translations of the Bible, early Christian and Jewish exegetes and eventually modern scholars.</p>
