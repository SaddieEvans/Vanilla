<p><h1>Angels in Abrahamic religions:</h2></p>
<p><h2>1. Judaism</p></h2>
<p>The Torah uses the terms <i lang="heb">mal&#39;kh elohim</i> - messenger of God, <i lang="heb">mal&#39;kh YHWH</i> - messenger of the Lord, <i lang="heb"> bane elohim - sons of God</i> and 
  <i lang="heb">haqqodesim</i> - the holy ones to refer to beings traditionally interpreted as angels. Later texts use other terms, such as <i lang="heb"> ha&#39;elyonim</i> - the upper ones. 
  The term <i lang="heb">mal&#39;akh</i>is also used in other books of the Tanakh. Depending on the context, the Hebrew word may refer to a human messenger or to a supernatural messenger. 
  A human messenger might be a prophet or priest, such as Malachi, <i>my messenger</i>; the Greek superscription in the Septuagint translation states the Book of Malachi was written 
  <i>by the hand of his messenger</i> <i lang="grc">angelu</i>. Examples of a supernatural messenger are the <i>Malak YHWH</i> who is either a messenger from God, an aspect of God (such as the Logos), 
  or God himself as the messenger - the <i>theophanic angel.</i> Scholar <b class="person">Michael D. Coogan</b> notes that it is only in the late books that the terms "come to mean the benevolent 
  semi-divine beings familiar from later mythology and art." <em>Daniel is the first biblical figure to refer to individual angels by name</em>, mentioning Gabriel (God's primary messenger) in Daniel 
  9:21 and Michael (the holy fighter) in Daniel 10:13. These angels are part of Daniel's apocalyptic visions and are an important part of all apocalyptic literature.</p>
<p>In Daniel 7, Daniel receives a dream-vision from God. <cite> As Daniel watches, the Ancient of Days takes his seat on the throne of heaven and sits in judgement in the midst of the heavenly court 
  [...] an [angel] like a son of man approaches the Ancient One in the clouds of heaven and is given everlasting kingship.</cite>
Coogan explains the development of this concept of angels: <cite>In the postexilic period, with the development of explicit monotheism, these divine beings, the 'sons of God' who were members of the 
  Divine Council were in effect demoted to what are now known as 'angels', understood as beings created by God, but immortal and thus superior to humans.</cite> This conception of angels is best 
  understood in contrast to demons and is often thought to be influenced by the ancient Persian religious tradition of Zoroastrianism, which viewed the world as a battleground between forces of good 
  and forces of evil, between light and darkness. </p>
<p>Philo of Alexandria identifies the angel with the Logos in as much as the angel is the immaterial voice of God. The angel is something different from God himself, but is conceived as God's 
  instrument.</p>
<p>In post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels took on particular significance and developed unique personalities and roles. Although these archangels were believed to rank among the heavenly host, no 
  systematic hierarchy ever developed. <b class="archangel">Metatron</b> is considered one of the highest of the angels in Merkabah and Kabbalist mysticism and often serves as a scribe; he is briefly 
  mentioned in the Talmud and figures prominently in Merkabah mystical texts. <b class="archangel">Michael</b>, who serves as a warrior and advocate for Israel (Daniel 10:13), is looked upon 
  particularly fondly. <b class="archangel">Gabriel</b> is mentioned in the Book of Daniel (Daniel 8:15, 17) and briefly in the Talmud, as well as in many Merkabah mystical texts. There is no evidence 
  in Judaism for the worship of angels, but there is evidence for the invocation and sometimes even conjuration of angels. According to Kabbalah, there are four worlds and our world is the last world: 
  the world of action - <b class="worlds">Assiyah</b>. Angels exist in the worlds above as a 'task' of God. They are an extension of God to produce effects in this world. After an angel has completed 
  it's task, it ceases to exist. The angel is in effect the task. This is derived from the book of Genesis when Abraham meets with three angels and Lot meets with two. The task of one of the angels was 
  to inform Abraham of his coming child. The other two were to save Lot and to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p><h2>2. Christianity</h2></p>
<p>Later Christians inherited Jewish understandings of angels, which in turn may have been partly inherited from the Egyptians. In the early stage, the Christian concept of an angel characterized the 
  angel as a messenger of God. Later came identification of individual angelic messengers: <em>Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and Uriel.</em> Then, in the space of little more than two centuries 
  (from the 3rd to the 5th) the <em>image of angels took on definite characteristics both in theology and in art.</em></p>
<p>By the late 4th century, the Church Fathers agreed that there were different categories of angels, with appropriate missions and activities assigned to them. There was, however, some disagreement 
  regarding the nature of angels. Some argued that angels had physical bodies, while some maintained that they were entirely spiritual. Some theologians had proposed that angels were not divine but on 
  the level of immaterial beings subordinate to the Trinity. The resolution of this Trinitarian dispute included the development of doctrine about angels.</p>
<p><h2>3. Islam</h2></p>
<p>Belief in angels is fundamental to Islam. The Quranic word for angel - <i lang="ara">malak</i> derives either from <i>Malaka</i>, meaning <i>he controlled</i>, due to their power to govern different 
  affairs assigned to them, or from the root either from <i lang="ara">'-l-k</i>, <i lang="ara">l-'-k</i> or <i lang="ara">m-l-k</i> with the broad meaning of a "messenger", just like its counterparts 
  in Hebrew and Greek. Unlike their Hebrew counterpart, the term is exclusively used for heavenly spirits of the divine world, but not for human messengers. The Quran refers to both angelic and human 
  messengers as <i>rasul</i> instead. The Quran is the principal source for the Islamic concept of angels. Some of them, such as Gabriel and Michael, are mentioned by name in the Quran, others are only
  referred to by their function. In hadith literature, angels are often assigned to only one specific phenomena. Angels play a significant role in Mi'raj literature, where Muhammad encounters several 
  angels during his journey through the heavens. Further angels have often been featured in Islamic eschatology, Islamic theology and Islamic philosophy. Duties assigned to angels include, for example, 
  communicating revelations from God, glorifying God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's soul at the time of death. In Islam, just like in Judaism and Christianity, angels are often
  represented in anthropomorphic forms combined with supernatural images, such as wings, being of great size or wearing heavenly articles. The Quran describes them as 
  <cite>messengers with wings: two, or three, or four (pairs): He [God] adds to Creation as He pleases...</cite> Common characteristics for angels are their missing needs for bodily desires, such as 
  eating and drinking. Their lack of affinity to material desires is also expressed by their creation from light: Angels of mercy are created from nur (cold light) in opposition to the angels of 
  punishment created from nar (hot light). Muslims do not generally share the perceptions of angelic pictorial depictions, such as those found in Western art. Although believing in angels remain one of 
  Six Articles of Faith in Islam, one can not find a dogmatic angelology in Islamic tradition. Despite this, scholars had discussed the role of angels from specific canonical events, such as the Mi'raj, 
  and Quranic verses. Even if they are not in focus, they have been featured in folklore, philosophy debates and systematic theology. While in classical Islam, widespread notions were accepted as 
  canonical, there is a tendecy in contemporary scholarship to reject much material about angels, like calling the Angel of Death by the name <strong>Azra'il</strong>. In Folk Islam, individual angels 
  may be evoked in <strong>exorcism rites</strong>, whose names are engraved in talismans or amulets. Some modern scholars have emphasized a metaphorical reinterpretation of the concept of angels.</p>
